We will be starting with 'How to install Django' and then we shall proceed to 'Creating the first project'

So to install Django you'll have to have python installed into your system.
To install python go to https://www.python.org/getit/
  **Python 3.7.0 is the latest. I'm not sure they released a 32bit version or not. Also there are a lot of deprecations in the libraries
    So if you want to learn python as well go for Version 2.7. It has both 32bit(x86) and 64bit(x64) versions.
After installation is completed, add the path to the folder 'Python27' (That python version2.7) to Path variable in Environment varibles.
    **If you're not sure how to get path variables, here it is "Right Click on 'My Computer/This PC'>Properties>Advanced system settings>Advanced>Environment Variables>Variable>Path
    Add a ';' and paste the folder path.
Open Command Prompt in Admin and type "easy_install --version". If CMD doesn't recognize the command go to the Python folder and open the 'Scripts' folder. Copy the path and add it into the path variable
Now your basics are done. You're ready to play.

****The Above steps are not required for Linux, as Python comes pre installed in Linux****

Installing Django

Step 1: type 'easy_install django'
      *This will install the latest version of Django compatible with your device. Django 2.0.7 is latest however it does not work with a 32 bit machine
Step 2: After installation is complete type 'django-admin --version'
      *This will show you the version installed in your machine which would also mean that Django is running good.
Step 3: Now go to the folder you want to create your project in. Hold Shift and Right-Click. Click on 'Open command window here'
Step 4: Type 'django-admin startproject <project_name>'
Step 5: Change the directory using 'cd <project_name>'
Step 6: Type 'python manage.py migrate' See Django documentation https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/migrations/
Step 7:Type 'python manage.py runserver'
      *Go to your browser and type the url 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' If everything is fine you'll see a "Congratulations"
      *The IP address 127.0.0.1 is also called Loopback IP or Localhost
Step 8: Do not close CMD.
      
Now you're ready to code. I prefer PyCharm for the coding. But you can use any IDE or text editor like notepad or Notepad++.
For beginners it is better to use PyCharm.

Coding the first project.

Step 1: Open the file 'urls.py' and add a path
    a. If it is a landing page without any parent page add the list item "path('', views.new_page, name='new_page')" in  the urlpatterns list.
    b. If it is a child page add the list item as "path('parent/', views.new_page, name='new_page')"
Step 2: Create a python file 'views.py' in the project directory
Step 3: Use the following code to connect the url to the view
            def new_page(request):
              return render(request, 'new_page.html')
              
        *This will show render as error. Click on render and then click on the little red bulb that'll appear(only in pycharm).
        *Click on 'Import from Django'
        *For others type "from django.shortcuts import render" at the top of the file
Step 4: Go to 'urls.py' and add "from . import views" at the top of the file
Step 5: Create a directory 'templates' within the scope of the parent directory.
Step 6: Create and HTML file 'new_page.html'
Step 7: Type "Hello World" within the body
Step 8: Go to 'settings.py'
Step 9: Scroll down to 'TEMPLATES' list
Step 10: In 'DIRS':[], add the name of the folder containing the html files. In this case, templates
        * 'DIRS':['templates']
Step 11: Run server using command 'python manage.py runserver' in cmd to check if there are any errors
Step 12: Run the IP http://127.0.0.1:8000
Step 13: And the First project is done.
