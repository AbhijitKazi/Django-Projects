Adding URLS is just rendering another template

Here are the steps that will enable you to add urls just like pure HTMl hyperlinks

Step 1: Go to the file 'urls.py' and add the folowing code to add the urls
        in the list 'urlpatterns'
            path('page', views.page, name='page')
Step 2: Now go to the file 'views.py' to define the view
            def page(request):
                return render(request, 'page.html')
        ***This will render the html page
Step 3: Go to the link and
        replace <a href = "page.html">Page</a>
        by      <a href = "{% url 'page' %}">Page</a>
